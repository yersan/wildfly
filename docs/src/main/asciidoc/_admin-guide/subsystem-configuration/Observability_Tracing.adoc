= OpenTelemetry Subsystem Configuration

[[required-extension-opentelemetry]]
== Extension

This extension is included in all the standalone configurations included in the WildFly distribution.

== Configuration

Systems administrators can configure a number of aspects of OpenTelemetry: the exporter, span processor, and sampler.

=== Exporter

The exporter can be selected and configured using the `exporter` child element, which supports these attributes:

* `exporter`: WildFly supports two different exporters:
** `jaeger`: The default exporter
** `otlp`: The OpenTelemetry protocol
* `endpoint`: The URL via which OpenTelemetry will push traces. The default is Jaeger's gRPC-based endpoint,
http://localhost:14250

=== Span Processor
The span process is configured via the `span-processor` element, which supports the following attributes:

* `type`: The type of span processor to use.
** `batch`: The default processor, which sends traces in batches as configured via the remaining attributes
** `simple`: Traces are pushed to the exporter as they finish.
* `batch-delay`: The amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait before traces are published (default: 5000)
* `max-queue-size`: The maximum size of the queue before traces are dropped (default: 2048)
* `max-export-batch-size`: The maximum number of traces that are published in each batch, which must be smaller or equal
to `max-queue-size (default: 512)
* `export-timeout`: The maximum amount of time in milliseconds to allow for an export to complete before being cancelled
(default: 30000)

=== Sampler

The sampler is configured via the `sampler` element:

* `type`: The type of sampler to use
** `on`: Always on (all traces are recorded)
** `off`: Always off (no traces are recorded)
** `ratio`: Return a ratio of the traces (e.g., 1 trace in 10000).
* `sampler-arg`: The value use to configure the `ratio` sampler, which must be within [0.0, 1.0]. For example, if 1
trace in 10,000 is to recorded, this value would be `0.0001`.

=== Example Configuration

The following XML is an example of the full configuration, including default values (WildFly does not persist default
values, so what you see in the configuration file may look different):

[code,xml]
-----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:wildfly:opentelemetry:1.0" service-name="example">
    <exporter type="jaeger" endpoint="http://localhost:14250"/>
    <span-processor type="batch" batch-delay="4500" max-queue-size="128"
        max-export-batch-size="512" export-timeout="45"/>
    <sampler type="on" sampler-arg="1"/>
</subsystem>

== Application Usage

All incoming REST requests are automatically traced, so no work need be done in user applications. If a REST request is
received and the OpenTelemetry context propagation header (`traceparent`) is present, the request will traced as part of
the remote trace context automatically.

Likewise, all Jakarta REST Client calls will have the trace context added to outgoing request headers so that requests
to external applications can be traced correctly (assuming the remote system properly handles OpenTelemetry trace context
propagation). If the REST Client call is made to another application on the local WildFly server, or a remote server of
the same version or later, the trace context will propagate automatically as described above.

While automatic tracing may be sufficient in many cases, it will often be desirable to have traces occur throughout the
user application. To support that, WildFly makes available the `OpenTelemetry` and `Tracer` instances, via CDI injection.
A user application, then is able to create arbitrary spans as part of the server-managed trace:

[code,java]
-----
@Path("/myEndpoint")
public class MyEndpoint {
    @Inject
    private Tracer tracer;

    @GET
    public Response doSomeWork() {
        final Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("Doing some work")
                .startSpan();
        span.makeCurrent();
        doSomeMoreWork();
        span.addEvent("Make request to external system.");
        makeExternalRequest();
        span.addEvent("All the work is done.");
        span.end();

        return Response.ok().build();
}
